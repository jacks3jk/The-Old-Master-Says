6	\nOne\n\nThe Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nEver desireless, one can see the mystery.\nEver desiring, one sees the manifestations.\nThese two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness.\nDarkness within darkness.\nThe gate to all mystery.\n\n \n\n\nTwo\n\nUnder heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.\nAll can know good as good only because there is evil.\n\nTherefore having and not having arise together.\nDifficult and easy complement each other.\nLong and short contrast each other:\nHigh and low rest upon each other;\nVoice and sound harmonize each other;\nFront and back follow one another.\n\nTherefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking.\nThe ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,\nCreating, yet not possessing.\nWorking, yet not taking credit.\nWork is done, then forgotten.\nTherefore it lasts forever.\n\n \n\n\nThree\n\nNot exalting the gifted prevents quarreling.\nNot collecting treasures prevents stealing.\nNot seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.\n\nThe wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.\nIf men lack knowledge and desire, then clever people will not try to interfere.\nIf nothing is done, then all will be well.\n\n \n\n\nFour\n\nThe Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled.\nOh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things!\nBlunt the sharpness,\nUntangle the knot,\nSoften the glare,\nMerge with dust.\nOh, hidden deep but ever present!\nI do not know from whence it comes.\nIt is the forefather of the gods.\n\n \n\n\nFive\n\nHeaven and Earth are impartial;\nThey see the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe wise are impartial;\nThey see the people as straw dogs.\n\nThe space between heaven and Earth is like a bellows.\nThe shape changes but not the form;\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMore words count less.\nHold fast to the center.\n\n \n\n\nSix\n\nThe valley spirit never dies;\nIt is the woman, primal mother.\nHer gateway is the root of heaven and Earth.\nIt is like a veil barely seen.\nUse it; it will never fail.\n\n \n\n\nSeven\n\nHeaven and Earth last forever.\nWhy do heaven and Earth last forever?\nThey are unborn,\nSo ever living.\nThe sage stays behind, thus he is ahead.\nHe is detached, thus at one with all.\nThrough selfless action, he attains fulfillment.\n\n \n\n\nEight\n\nThe highest good is like water.\nWater give life to the ten thousand things and does not strive.\nIt flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao.\n\nIn dwelling, be close to the land.\nIn meditation, go deep in the heart.\nIn dealing with others, be gentle and kind.\nIn speech, be true.\nIn ruling, be just.\nIn daily life, be competent.\nIn action, be aware of the time and the season.\n\nNo fight: No blame.\n\n \n\n\nNine\n\nBetter to stop short than fill to the brim.\nOversharpen the blade, and the edge will soon blunt.\nAmass a store of gold and jade, and no one can protect it.\nClaim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow.\nRetire when the work is done.\nThis is the way of heaven.\n\n \n\n\nTen\n\nCarrying body and soul and embracing the one,\nCan you avoid separation?\nAttending fully and becoming supple,\nCan you be as a newborn babe?\nWashing and cleansing the primal vision,\nCan you be without stain?\nLoving all men and ruling the country,\nCan you be without cleverness?\nOpening and closing the gates of heaven,\nCan you play the role of woman?\nUnderstanding and being open to all things,\nAre you able to do nothing?\nGiving birth and nourishing,\nBearing yet not possessing,\nWorking yet not taking credit,\nLeading yet not dominating,\nThis is the Primal Virtue.\n\n \n\n\nEleven\n\nThirty spokes share the wheel's hub;\nIt is the center hole that makes it useful.\nShape clay into a vessel;\nIt is the space within that makes it useful.\nCut doors and windows for a room;\nIt is the holes which make it useful.\nTherefore benefit comes from what is there;\nUsefulness from what is not there.\n\n \n\n\nTwelve\n\nThe five colors blind the eye.\nThe five tones deafen the ear.\nThe five flavors dull the taste.\nRacing and hunting madden the mind.\nPrecious things lead one astray.\n\nTherefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees.\nHe lets go of that and chooses this.\n\n \n\n\nThirteen\n\nAccept disgrace willingly.\nAccept misfortune as the human condition.\n\nWhat do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"?\nAccept being unimportant.\nDo not be concerned with loss or gain.\nThis is called "accepting disgrace willingly."\n\nWhat do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"?\nMisfortune comes from having a body.\nWithout a body, how could there be misfortune?\n\nSurrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.\nLove the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.\n\n \n\n\nFourteen\n\nLook, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form.\nListen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound.\nGrasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible.\nThese three are indefinable;\nTherefore they are joined in one.\n\nFrom above it is not bright;\nFrom below it is not dark:\nAn unbroken thread beyond description.\nIt returns to nothingness.\nThe form of the formless,\nThe image of the imageless,\nIt is called indefinable and beyond imagination.\n\nStand before it and there is no beginning.\nFollow it and there is no end.\nStay with the ancient Tao,\nMove with the present.\n\nKnowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.\n\n \n\n\nFifteen\n\nThe ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive.\nThe depth of their knowledge is unfathomable.\nBecause it is unfathomable,\nAll we can do is describe their appearance.\nWatchful, like men crossing a winter stream.\nAlert, like men aware of danger.\nCourteous, like visiting guests.\nYielding like ice about to melt.\nSimple, like uncarved blocks of wood.\nHollow, like caves.\nOpaque, like muddy pools.\n\nWho can wait quietly while the mud settles?\nWho can remain still until the moment of action?\nObservers of the Tao do not seek fulfillment.\nNot seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.\n\n \n\n\nSixteen\n\nEmpty yourself of everything.\nLet the mind become still.\nThe ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.\nThey grow and flourish and then return to the source.\nReturning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.\nThe way of nature is unchanging.\nKnowing constancy is insight.\nNot knowing constancy leads to disaster.\nKnowing constancy, the mind is open.\nWith an open mind, you will be openhearted.\nBeing openhearted, you will act royally.\nBeing royal, you will attain the divine.\nBeing divine, you will be at one with the Tao.\nBeing at one with the Tao is eternal.\nAnd though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.\n\n \n\n\nSeventeen\n\nThe very highest if barely known.\nThen comes that which people know and love.\nThen that which is feared,\nThen that which is despised.\n\nWho does not trust enough will not be trusted.\n\nWhen actions are performed\nWithout unnecessary speech,\nPeople say, "We did it!"\n\n \n\n\nEighteen\n\nWhen the great Tao is forgotten,\nKindness and morality arise.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence are born,\nThe great pretense begins.\n\nWhen there is no peace within the family,\nFilial piety and devotion arise.\nWhen the country is confused and in chaos,\nLoyal ministers appear.\n\n \n\n\nNineteen\n\nGive up sainthood, renounce wisdom,\nAnd it will be a hundred times better for everyone.\n\nGive up kindness, renounce morality,\nAnd men will rediscover filial piety and love.\n\nGive up ingenuity, renounce profit,\nAnd bandits and thieves will disappear.\n\nThese three are outward forms alone; they are not sufficient in themselves.\nIt is more important\nTo see the simplicity,\nTo realize one's true nature,\nTo cast off selfishness\nAnd temper desire.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty\n\nGive up learning, and put an end to your troubles.\n\nIs there a difference between yes and no?\nIs there a difference between good and evil?\nMust I fear what others fear? What nonsense!\nOther people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox.\nIn spring some go to the park, and climb the terrace,\nBut I alone am drifting, not knowing where I am.\nLike a newborn babe before it learns to smile,\nI am alone, without a place to go.\n\nOthers have more than they need, but I alone have nothing.\nI am a fool. Oh, yes! I am confused.\nOthers are clear and bright,\nBut I alone am dim and weak.\nOthers are sharp and clever,\nBut I alone am dull and stupid.\nOh, I drift like the waves of the sea,\nWithout direction, like the restless wind.\n\nEveryone else is busy,\nBut I alone am aimless and depressed.\nI am different.\nI am nourished by the great mother.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-one\n\nThe greatest Virtue is to follow Tao and Tao alone.\nThe Tao is elusive and intangible.\nOh, it is intangible and elusive, and yet within is image.\nOh, it is elusive and intangible, and yet within is form.\nOh, it is dim and dark, and yet within is essence.\nThis essence is very real, and therein lies faith.\nFrom the very beginning until now its name has never been forgotten.\nThus I perceive the creation.\nHow do I know the ways of creation?\nBecause of this.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-two\n\nYield and overcome;\nBend and be straight;\nEmpty and be full;\nWear out and be new;\nHave little and gain;\nHave much and be confused.\n\nTherefore the wise embrace the one\nAnd set an example to all.\nNot putting on a display,\nThey shine forth.\nNot justifying themselves,\nThey are distinguished.\nNot boasting,\nThey receive recognition.\nNot bragging,\nThey never falter.\nThey do not quarrel,\nSo no one quarrels with them.\nTherefore the ancients say, "Yield and overcome."\nIs that an empty saying?\nBe really whole,\nAnd all things will come to you.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-three\n\nTo talk little is natural.\nHigh winds do not last all morning.\nHeavy rain does not last all day.\nWhy is this? Heaven and Earth!\nIf heaven and Earth cannot make things eternal,\nHow is it possible for man?\n\nHe who follows the Tao\nIs at one with the Tao.\nHe who is virtuous\nExperiences Virtue.\nHe who loses the way\nIs lost.\nWhen you are at one with the Tao,\nThe Tao welcomes you.\nWhen you are at one with Virtue,\nThe Virtue is always there.\nWhen you are at one with loss,\nThe loss is experienced willingly.\n\nHe who does not trust enough\nWill not be trusted.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-four\n\nHe who stands on tiptoe is not steady.\nHe who strides cannot maintain the pace.\nHe who makes a show is not enlightened.\nHe who is self-righteous is not respected.\nHe who boasts achieves nothing.\nHe who brags will not endure.\nAccording to followers of the Tao, "These are extra food and unnecessary luggage."\nThey do not bring happiness.\ntherefore followers of the Tao avoid them.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-five\n\nSomething mysteriously formed,\nBorn before heaven and Earth.\nIn the silence and the void,\nStanding alone and unchanging,\nEver present and in motion.\nPerhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.\nI do not know its name\nCall it Tao.\nFor lack of a better word, I call it great.\n\nBeing great, it flows\nI flows far away.\nHaving gone far, it returns.\n\nTherefore, "Tao is great;\nHeaven is great;\nEarth is great;\nThe king is also great."\nThese are the four great powers of the universe,\nAnd the king is one of them.\n\nMan follows Earth.\nEarth follows heaven.\nHeaven follows the Tao.\nTao follows what is natural.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-six\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light.\nThe still is the master of unrest.\n\nTherefore the sage, traveling all day,\nDoes not lose sight of his baggage.\nThough there are beautiful things to be seen,\nHe remains unattached and calm.\n\nWhy should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly in public?\nTo be light is to lose one's root.\nTo be restless is to lose one's control.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-seven\n\nA good walker leaves no tracks;\nA good speaker makes no slips;\nA good reckoner needs no tally.\nA good door needs no lock,\nYet no one can open it.\nGood binding requires no knots,\nYet no one can loosen it.\n\nTherefore the sage takes care of all men\nAnd abandons no one.\nHe takes care of all things\nAnd abandons nothing.\n\nThis is called "following the light."\n\nWhat is a good man?\nA teacher of a bad man.\nWhat is a bad man?\nA good man's charge.\nIf the teacher is not respected,\nAnd the student not cared for,\nConfusion will arise, however clever one is.\nThis is the crux of mystery.\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-eight\n\nKnow the strength of man,\nBut keep a woman's care!\nBe the stream of the universe!\nBeing the stream of the universe,\nEver true and unswerving,\nBecome as a little child once more.\n\nKnow the white,\nBut keep the black!\nBe an example to the world!\nBeing an example to the world,\nEver true and unwavering,\nReturn to the infinite.\n\nKnow honor,\nYet keep humility.\nBe the valley of the universe!\nBeing the valley of the universe,\nEver true and resourceful,\nReturn to the state of the uncarved block.\n\nWhen the block is carved, it becomes useful.\nWhen the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler.\nThus, "A great tailor cuts little."\n\n \n\n\nTwenty-nine\n\nDo you think you can take over the universe and improve it?\nI do not believe it can be done.\n\nThe universe is sacred.\nYou cannot improve it.\nIf you try to change it, you will ruin it.\nIf you try to hold it, you will lose it.\n\nSo sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;\nSometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;\nSometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;\nSometimes one is up and sometimes down.\n\nTherefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.\n\n \n\n\nThirty\n\nWhenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao,\nCounsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.\nFor this would only cause resistance.\nThorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed.\nLean years follow in the wake of a great war.\nJust do what needs to be done.\nNever take advantage of power.\n\nAchieve results,\nBut never glory in them.\nAchieve results,\nBut never boast.\nAchieve results,\nBut never be proud.\nAchieve results,\nBecause this is the natural way.\nAchieve results,\nBut not through violence.\n\nForce is followed by loss of strength.\nThis is not the way of Tao.\nThat which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-one\n\nGood weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them.\nTherefore followers of Tao never use them.\nThe wise man prefers the left.\nThe man of war prefers the right.\n\nWeapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools.\nHe uses them only when he has no choice.\nPeace and quiet are dear to his heart,\nAnd victory no cause for rejoicing.\nIf you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing;\nIf you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.\n\nOn happy occasions precedence is given to the left,\nOn sad occasions to the right.\nIn the army the general stands on the left,\nThe commander-in-chief on the right.\nThis means that war is conducted like a funeral.\nWhen many people are being killed,\nThey should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow.\nThat is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-two\n\nThe Tao is forever undefined.\nSmall though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.\nIf kings and lords could harness it,\nThe ten thousand things would come together\nAnd gentle rain fall.\nMen would need no more instruction and all things would take their course.\n\nOnce the whole is divided, the parts need names.\nThere are already enough names.\nOne must know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop averts trouble.\nTao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-three\n\nKnowing others is wisdom;\nKnowing the self is enlightenment.\nMastering others requires force;\nMastering the self needs strength.\n\nHe who knows he has enough is rich.\nPerseverance is a sign of willpower.\nHe who stays where he is endures.\nTo die but not to perish is to be eternally present.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-four\n\nThe great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right.\nThe ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back.\nIt fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim.\n\nIt nourishes the ten thousand things,\nAnd yet is not their lord.\nIt has no aim; it is very small.\n\nThe ten thousand things return to it,\nYet it is not their lord.\nIt is very great.\n\nIt does not show greatness,\nAnd is therefore truly great.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-five\n\nAll men will come to him who keeps to the one,\nFor there lie rest and happiness and peace.\n\nPassersby may stop for music and good food,\nBut a description of the Tao\nSeems without substance or flavor.\nIt cannot be seen, it cannot be heard,\nAnd yet it cannot be exhausted.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-six\n\nThat which shrinks\nMust first expand.\nThat which fails\nMust first be strong.\nThat which is cast down\nMust first be raised.\nBefore receiving\nThere must be giving.\n\nThis is called perception of the nature of things.\nSoft and weak overcome hard and strong.\n\nFish cannot leave deep waters,\nAnd a country's weapons should not be displayed.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-seven\n\nTao abides in non-action,\nYet nothing is left undone.\nIf kings and lords observed this,\nThe ten thousand things would develop naturally.\nIf they still desired to act,\nThey would return to the simplicity of formless substance.\nWithout form there is no desire.\nWithout desire there is tranquility.\nAnd in this way all things would be at peace.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-eight\n\nA truly good man is not aware of his goodness,\nAnd is therefore good.\nA foolish man tries to be good,\nAnd is therefore not good.\n\nA truly good man does nothing,\nYet leaves nothing undone.\nA foolish man is always doing,\nYet much remains to be done.\n\nWhen a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone.\nWhen a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done.\nWhen a disciplinarian does something and no one responds,\nHe rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order.\n\nTherefore when Tao is lost, there is goodness.\nWhen goodness is lost, there is kindness.\nWhen kindness is lost, there is justice.\nWhen justice is lost, there ritual.\nNow ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion.\nKnowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of Tao.\nIt is the beginning of folly.\n\nTherefore the truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface,\nOn the fruit and not the flower.\nTherefore accept the one and reject the other.\n\n \n\n\nThirty-nine\n\nThese things from ancient times arise from one:\nThe sky is whole and clear.\nThe earth is whole and firm.\nThe spirit is whole and strong.\nThe valley is whole and full.\nThe ten thousand things are whole and alive.\nKings and lords are whole, and the country is upright.\nAll these are in virtue of wholeness.\n\nThe clarity of the sky prevents its falling.\nThe firmness of the earth prevents its splitting.\nThe strength of the spirit prevents its being used up.\nThe fullness of the valley prevents its running dry.\nThe growth of the ten thousand things prevents their drying out.\nThe leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall of the country.\n\nTherefore the humble is the root of the noble.\nThe low is the foundation of the high.\nPrinces and lords consider themselves "orphaned", "widowed" and "worthless".\nDo they not depend on being humble?\n\nToo much success is not an advantage.\nDo not tinkle like jade\nOr clatter like stone chimes.\n\n \n\n\nForty\n\nReturning is the motion of the Tao.\nYielding is the way of the Tao.\nThe ten thousand things are born of being.\nBeing is born of not being.\n\n \n\n\nForty-one\n\nThe wise student hears of the Tao and practices it diligently.\nThe average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and again.\nThe foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud.\nIf there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is.\n\nHence it is said:\nThe bright path seems dim;\nGoing forward seems like retreat;\nThe easy way seems hard;\nThe highest Virtue seems empty;\nGreat purity seems sullied;\nA wealth of Virtue seems inadequate;\nThe strength of Virtue seems frail;\nReal Virtue seems unreal;\nThe perfect square has no corners;\nGreat talents ripen late;\nThe highest notes are hard to hear;\nThe greatest form has no shape;\nThe Tao is hidden and without name.\nThe Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.\n\n \n\n\nForty-two\n\nThe Tao begot one.\nOne begot two.\nTwo begot three.\nAnd three begot the ten thousand things.\n\nThe ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.\nThey achieve harmony by combining these forces.\n\nMen hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless,"\nBut this is how kings and lords describe themselves.\n\nFor one gains by losing\nAnd loses by gaining.\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach; that is:\n"A violent man will die a violent death!"\nThis will be the essence of my teaching.\n\n \n\n\nForty-three\n\nThe softest thing in the universe\nOvercomes the hardest thing in the universe.\nThat without substance can enter where there is no room.\nHence I know the value of non-action.\n\nTeaching without words and work without doing\nAre understood by very few.\n\n \n\n\nForty-four\n\nFame or self: Which matters more?\nSelf or wealth: Which is more precious?\nGain or loss: Which is more painful?\n\nHe who is attached to things will suffer much.\nHe who saves will suffer heavy loss.\nA contented man is never disappointed.\nHe who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.\nHe will stay forever safe.\n\n \n\n\nForty-five\n\nGreat accomplishment seems imperfect,\nYet it does not outlive its usefulness.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nYet cannot be exhausted.\n\nGreat straightness seems twisted.\nGreat intelligence seems stupid.\nGreat eloquence seems awkward.\n\nMovement overcomes cold.\nStillness overcomes heat.\nStillness and tranquillity set things in order in the universe.\n\n \n\n\nForty-six\n\nWhen the Tao is present in the universe,\nThe horses haul manure.\nWhen the Tao is absent from the universe,\nWar horses are bred outside the city.\n\nThere is no greater sin than desire,\nNo greater curse than discontent,\nNo greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself.\nTherefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.\n\n \n\n\nForty-seven\n\nWithout going outside, you may know the whole world.\nWithout looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.\nThe farther you go, the less you know.\n\nThus the sage knows without traveling;\nHe sees without looking;\nHe works without doing.\n\n \n\n\nForty-eight\n\nIn the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.\nIn the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped.\n\nLess and less is done\nUntil non-action is achieved.\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.\n\nThe world is ruled by letting things take their course.\nIt cannot be ruled by interfering.\n\n \n\n\nForty-nine\n\nThe sage has no mind of his own.\nHe is aware of the needs of others.\n\nI am good to people who are good.\nI am also good to people who are not good.\nBecause Virtue is goodness.\nI have faith in people who are faithful.\nI also have faith in people who are not faithful.\nBecause Virtue is faithfulness.\n\nThe sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing.\nOthers look to him and listen.\nHe behaves like a little child.\n\n\n \n\n\nFifty\n\nBetween birth and death,\nThree in ten are followers of life,\nThree in ten are followers of death,\nAnd men just passing from birth to death also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they live their lives on the gross level.\n\nHe who knows how to live can walk abroad\nWithout fear of rhinoceros or tiger.\nHe will not be wounded in battle.\nFor in him rhinoceroses can find no place to thrust their horn,\nTigers no place to use their claws,\nAnd weapons no place to pierce.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause he has no place for death to enter.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-one\n\nAll things arise from Tao.\nThey are nourished by Virtue.\nThey are formed from matter.\nThey are shaped by environment.\nThus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor Virtue.\nRespect of Tao and honor of Virtue are not demanded,\nBut they are in the nature of things.\n\nTherefore all things arise from Tao.\nBy Virtue they are nourished,\nDeveloped, cared for,\nSheltered, comforted,\nGrown, and protected.\nCreating without claiming,\nDoing without taking credit,\nGuiding without interfering,\nThis is Primal Virtue.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-two\n\nThe beginning of the universe\nIs the mother of all things.\nKnowing the mother, one also knows the sons.\nKnowing the sons, yet remaining in touch with the mother,\nBrings freedom from the fear of death.\n\nKeep your mouth shut,\nGuard the senses,\nAnd life is ever full.\nOpen your mouth,\nAlways be busy,\nAnd life is beyond hope.\n\nSeeing the small is insight;\nYielding to force is strength.\nUsing the outer light, return to insight,\nAnd in this way be saved from harm.\nThis is learning constancy.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-three\n\nIf I have even just a little sense,\nI will walk on the main road and my only fear\nwill be of straying from it.\nKeeping to the main road is easy,\nBut people love to be sidetracked.\n\nWhen the court is arrayed in splendor,\nThe fields are full of weeds,\nAnd the granaries are bare.\nSome wear gorgeous clothes,\nCarry sharp swords,\nAnd indulge themselves with food and drink;\nThey have more possessions than they can use.\nThey are robber barons.\nThis is certainly not the way of Tao.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-four\n\nWhat is firmly established cannot be uprooted.\nWhat is firmly grasped cannot slip away.\nIt will be honored from generation to generation.\n\nCultivate Virtue in your self,\nAnd Virtue will be real.\nCultivate it in the family,\nAnd Virtue will abound.\nCultivate it in the village,\nAnd Virtue will grow.\nCultivate it in the nation,\nAnd Virtue will be abundant.\nCultivate it in the universe,\nAnd Virtue will be everywhere.\n\nTherefore look at the body as body;\nLook at the family as family;\nLook at the village as village;\nLook at the nation as nation;\nLook at the universe as universe.\n\nHow do I know the universe is like this?\nBy looking!\n\n \n\n\nFifty-five\n\nHe who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child.\nWasps and serpents will not sting him;\nWild beasts will not pounce upon him;\nHe will not be attacked by birds of prey.\nHis bones are soft, his muscles weak,\nBut his grip is firm.\nHe has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole.\nHis manhood is strong.\nHe screams all day without becoming hoarse.\nThis is perfect harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is constancy.\nKnowing constancy is enlightenment.\n\nIt is not wise to rush about.\nControlling the breath causes strain.\nIf too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.\nThis is not the way of Tao.\nWhatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-six\n\nThose who know do not talk.\nThose who talk do not know.\n\nKeep your mouth closed.\nGuard your senses.\nTemper your sharpness.\nSimplify your problems.\nMask your brightness.\nBe at one with the dust of the Earth.\nThis is primal union.\n\nHe who has achieved this state\nIs unconcerned with friends and enemies,\nWith good and harm, with honor and disgrace.\nThis therefore is the highest state of man.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-seven\n\nRule a nation with justice.\nWage war with surprise moves.\nBecome master of the universe without striving.\nHow do I know that this is so?\nBecause of this!\n\nThe more laws and restrictions there are,\nThe poorer people become.\nThe sharper men's weapons,\nThe more trouble in the land.\nThe more ingenious and clever men are,\nThe more strange things happen.\nThe more rules and regulations,\nThe more thieves and robbers.\n\nTherefore the sage says:\nI take no action and people are reformed.\nI enjoy peace and people become honest.\nI do nothing and people become rich.\nI have no desires and people return to the good and simple life.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-eight\n\nWhen the country is ruled with a light hand\nThe people are simple.\nWhen the country is ruled with severity,\nThe people are cunning.\n\nHappiness is rooted in misery.\nMisery lurks beneath happiness.\nWho knows what the future holds?\nThere is no honesty.\nHonesty becomes dishonest.\nGoodness becomes witchcraft.\nMan's bewitchment lasts for a long time.\n\nTherefore the sage is sharp but not cutting,\nPointed but not piercing,\nStraightforward but not unrestrained,\nBrilliant but not blinding.\n\n \n\n\nFifty-nine\n\nIn caring for others and serving heaven,\nThere is nothing like using restraint.\nRestraint begins with giving up one's own ideas.\nThis depends on Virtue gathered in the past.\nIf there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible.\nIf nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.\nIf a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler.\nThe mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time.\nThis is called having deep roots and a firm foundation,\nThe Tao of long life and eternal vision.\n\n \n\n\nSixty\n\nRuling the country is like cooking a small fish.\nApproach the universe with Tao,\nAnd evil is not powerful,\nBut its power will not be used to harm others.\nNot only will it do no harm to others,\nBut the sage himself will also be protected.\nThey do not hurt each other,\nAnd the Virtue in each one refreshes both.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-one\n\nA great country is like low land.\nIt is the meeting ground of the universe,\nThe mother of the universe.\n\nThe female overcomes the male with stillness,\nLying low in stillness.\n\nTherefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country,\nIt will conquer the smaller country.\nAnd if a small country submits to a great country,\nIt can conquer the great country.\nTherefore those who would conquer must yield,\nAnd those who conquer do so because they yield.\n\nA great nation needs more people;\nA small country needs to serve.\nEach gets what it wants.\nIt is fitting for a great nation to yield.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-two\n\nTao is source of the ten thousand things.\nIt is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad.\nSweet words can buy honor;\nGood deeds can gain respect.\nIf a man is bad, do not abandon him.\nTherefore on the day the emperor is crowned,\nOr the three officers of state installed,\nDo not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses,\nBut remain still and offer the Tao.\nWhy does everyone like the Tao so much at first?\nIsn't it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin?\nTherefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-three\n\nPractice non-action.\nWork without doing.\nTaste the tasteless.\nMagnify the small, increase the few.\nReward bitterness with care.\n\nSee simplicity in the complicated.\nAchieve greatness in little things.\n\nIn the universe the difficult things are done as if they are easy.\nIn the universe great acts are made up of small deeds.\nThe sage does not attempt anything very big,\nAnd thus achieved greatness.\n\nEasy promises make for little trust.\nTaking things lightly results in great difficulty.\nBecause the sage always confronts difficulties,\nHe never experiences them.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-four\n\nPeace is easily maintained;\nTrouble is easily overcome before it starts.\nThe brittle is easily shattered;\nThe small is easily scattered.\n\nDeal with it before it happens.\nSet things in order before there is confusion.\n\nA tree as great as a man's embrace springs up from a small shoot;\nA terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles starts under one's feet.\n\nHe who acts defeats his own purpose;\nHe who grasps loses.\nThe sage does not act, and so is not defeated.\nHe does not grasp and therefore does not lose.\n\nPeople usually fail when they are on the verge of success.\nSo give as much care to the end as to the beginning;\nThen there will be no failure.\n\nTherefore the sage seeks freedom from desire.\nHe does not collect precious things.\nHe learns not to hold on to ideas.\nHe brings men back to what they have lost.\nHe help the ten thousand things find their own nature,\nBut refrains from action.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-five\n\nIn the beginning those who knew the Tao did not try to enlighten others,\nBut kept it hidden.\nWhy is it so hard to rule?\nBecause people are so clever.\nRulers who try to use cleverness\nCheat the country.\nThose who rule without cleverness\nAre a blessing to the land.\nThese are the two alternatives.\nUnderstanding these is Primal Virtue.\nPrimal Virtue is deep and far.\nIt leads all things back\nToward the great oneness.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-six\n\nWhy is the sea king of a hundred streams?\nBecause it lies below them.\nTherefore it is the king of a hundred streams.\n\nIf the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility.\nIf he would lead them, he must follow behind.\nIn this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed;\nWhen he stands before them, they will not be harmed.\nThe whole world will support him and will not tire of him.\n\nBecause he does not compete,\nHe does not meet competition.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-seven\n\nEveryone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare.\nBecause it is great, it seems different.\nIf it were not different, it would have vanished long ago.\n\nI have three treasures which I hold and keep.\nThe first is mercy; the second is economy;\nThe third is daring not to be ahead of others.\nFrom mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;\nFrom humility comes leadership.\n\nNowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;\nThey abandon economy, but try to be generous;\nThey do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.\nThis is certain death.\n\nMercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.\nIt is the means by which heaven saves and guards.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-eight\n\nA good soldier is not violent.\nA good fighter is not angry.\nA good winner is not vengeful\nA good employer is humble.\nThis is known as the Virtue of not striving.\nThis is known as ability to deal with people.\nThis since ancient times has been known as the ultimate unity with heaven.\n\n \n\n\nSixty-nine\n\nThere is a saying among soldiers:\nI dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest;\nI dare not advance and inch but would rather withdraw a foot.\n\nThis is called marching without appearing to move,\nRolling up your sleeves without showing your arm,\nCapturing the enemy without attacking,\nBeing armed without weapons.\n\nThere is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy.\nBy underestimating the enemy, I almost lost what I value.\n\nTherefore when the battle is joined,\nThe underdog will win.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy\n\nMy words are easy to understand and easy to perform,\nYet no man under heaven knows them or practices them.\n\nMy words have ancient beginnings.\nMy actions are disciplined.\nBecause men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.\n\nThose that know me are few;\nThose that abuse me are honored.\nTherefore the sage wears rough clothing and holds the jewel in his heart.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-one\n\nKnowing ignorance is strength.\nIgnoring knowledge is sickness.\n\nIf one is sick of sickness, then one is not sick.\nThe sage is not sick because he is sick of sickness.\nTherefore he is not sick.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-two\n\nWhen men lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster.\n\nDo not intrude in their homes.\nDo not harass them at work.\nIf you do not interfere, they will not weary of you.\n\nTherefore the sage knows himself but makes no show,\nHas self-respect but is not arrogant.\nHe lets go of that and chooses this.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-three\n\nA brave and passionate man will kill or be killed.\nA brave and calm man will always preserve life.\nOf these two which is good and which is harmful?\nSome things are not favored by heaven. Who knows why?\nEven the sage is unsure of this.\n\nThe Tao of heaven does not strive, and yet it overcomes.\nIt does not speak, and yet is answered.\nIt does not ask, yet is supplied with all its needs.\nIt seems to have no aim and yet its purpose is fulfilled.\n\nHeaven's net casts wide.\nThough its meshes are course, nothing slips through.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-four\n\nIf men are not afraid to die,\nIt is no avail to threaten them with death.\n\nIf men live in constant fear of dying,\nAnd if breaking the law means that a man will be killed,\nWho will dare to break the law?\n\nThere is always an official executioner.\nIf you try to take his place,\nIt is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood.\nIf you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand.\n\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-five\n\nWhy are the people starving?\nBecause the rulers eat up the money in taxes.\nTherefore the people are starving.\n\nWhy are the people rebellious?\nBecause the rulers interfere too much.\nTherefore they are rebellious.\n\nWhy do the people think so little of death?\nBecause the rulers demand too much of life.\nTherefore the people take death lightly.\n\nHaving little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-six\n\nA man is born gentle and weak.\nAt his death he is hard and stiff.\nGreen plants are tender and filled with sap.\nAt their death they are withered and dry.\n\nTherefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.\nThe gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.\n\nThus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.\nA tree that is unbending is easily broken.\n\nThe hard and strong will fall.\nThe soft and weak will overcome.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-seven\n\nThe Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow.\nThe high is lowered, and the low is raised.\nIf the string is too long, it is shortened;\nIf there is not enough, it is made longer.\n\nThe Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much and give to those who do not have enough.\nMan's way is different.\nHe takes from those who do not have enough and give to those who already have too much.\nWhat man has more than enough and gives it to the world?\nOnly the man of Tao.\n\nTherefore the sage works without recognition.\nHe achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it.\nHe does not try to show his knowledge.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-eight\n\nUnder heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.\nYet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;\nIt has no equal.\nThe weak can overcome the strong;\nThe supple can overcome the stiff.\nUnder heaven everyone knows this,\nYet no one puts it into practice.\nTherefore the sage says:\nHe who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them.\nHe who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe.\nThe truth often sounds paradoxical.\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-nine\n\nAfter a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.\nWhat can one do about it?\nTherefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain\nBut does not exact his due.\nA man of Virtue performs his part,\nBut a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations.\nThe Tao of heaven is impartial.\nIt stays with good men all the time.\n\n \n\n\nEighty\n\nA small country has fewer people.\nThough there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.\nThe people take death seriously and do not travel far.\nThough they have boats and carriages, no one uses them.\nThough they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.\nMen return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.\nTheir food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;\nThey are happy in their ways.\nThough they live within sight of their neighbors,\nAnd crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,\nYet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.\n\n \n\n\nEighty-one\n\nTruthful words are not beautiful.\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nGood men do not argue.\nThose who argue are not good.\nThose who know are not learned.\nThe learned do not know.\n\nThe sage never tries to store things up.\nThe more he does for others, the more he has.\nThe more he gives to others, the greater his abundance.\nThe Tao of heaven is pointed but does no harm.\nThe Tao of the sage is work without effort.\n\n
